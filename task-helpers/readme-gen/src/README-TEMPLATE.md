This is a hobby project I decided to double as an experiment in developing a web application in JavaScript without the aid of a framework like React or Angular. Such an approach is often referred to as frameworkless, or vanilla JavaScript.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the approaches used are intentionally unconventional. Any attempt to emulate these approaches should be done with the unique needs and circumstances of your endeavour taken into consideration.

# Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture.svg)

Omitted for brievity:
- __Lib__: All depend on Lib except Config and IO.
- __Config__: All depend on Config except Elements and Lib.

A familiar presentation/domain/data __layered architecture__ has been used to manage __separation of concerns__. This is a common approach to modularise backend applications and therefore I hypothesise this design will be more approachable for backend developers.

## Architectural components

### Components

A plain object graph containing only _component builder functions_.

A __component builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to both user interaction and state changes (via subscriptions), may self-mutate, and interact with services.

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/tag-list/tag/components/tag-name.js') %>

Because component builder functions simply return native HTML elements, they can easily be appended to create component hierarchies.

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/header/header.js') %>

### Elements

A plain object graph containing only _element builder functions_.

An __element builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to user interaction, and may self-mutate.

Elements are 'fundamental' components. Unlike components, they cannot react to state changes or interact with services. For this reason, elements tend to be lower level, generic, and reusable.

<%- renderJsFile('src/elements/editable-span.js') %>

### Services

A plain object graph containing only _service functions_.

A __service function__ orchestrates domain logic and IO including state changes.

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __services__ comprise the 'imperative shell'.

<%- renderJsFile('src/services/tags/change-tag-instance-name.js') %>

### Core

A plain object graph containing only _pure functions_.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function):
> In computer programming, a __pure function__ is a function that has the following properties:
> 1. Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices).
> 2. Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __core__ comprises the 'functional core'.

<%- renderJsFile('src/core/tags/parse-tag-expression.js') %>

### IO

A plain object graph containing only functions that that depend on or act on the environment. 

<%- renderJsFile('src/io/io.js') %>

### Subscriptions

A plain object graph containing only _subscription functions_.

A __subscription function__ enables a listener to be notified of state changes.

### Stores

A plain object graph containing only instances of _state stores_.

A __state store__ encapsulates state mutations and notifications.

### Lib

A plain object graph containing only utility functions without collaborators.

### Config

A plain object graph containing only primitive data types.

# State management

Avoiding state management libraries forces the need for a bespoke state management solution.
No attempt is made to generify the state management solution for reuse by other applications; rather it is designed to evolve with the specific needs of this application.

## Stores

State is managed by a series of _state stores_. 

A **state store** is collection of data items keyed by a unique identifier and managed using typical CRUD operations such as `insert`, `remove`, `getState` and `setState`.

<%- renderJsFile('src/lib/storage/state-store.js', { open: false }) %>

__Example: Inserting a role using `insert`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/services/roles/insert-role.js') %>

__Example: Changing a role name using `getState` and `setState`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/services/roles/change-role-name.js') %>

## Subscriptions

State stores use the [observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to enable consumers to react to state changes by associating _listener_ functions to events such as `onInsert` and `onChange`.

The observer pattern is easily implemented with Node's [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) which can be bundled directly into the application.

During startup, subscription functions are extracted from the stores into a standalone _subscriptions_ object. This decouples subscribers (namely _services_ and _components_) from the stores making them agnostic of the data source. Although not a design goal for this application, this should allow the data source to change without impacting the subscribers provided the interface of the subscription functions do not change.

__Example: Reacting to a new role using `onInsert` and `onFirstInsert`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/role-list/role-list.js') %>

__Example: Reacting to the change of a role name using `onChange`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/role-list/role-customiser/master-role-name.js') %>


# Testing 

## Constraints

- Unit test suite optimised for speed. Max 10 seconds.
  - [TDD test suites should run in 10 seconds or less - Mark Seemann](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/05/24/TDDtestsuitesshouldrunin10secondsorless/)
- No BDD style assertion libraries, e.g. expect. Used assert instead.
  - [I strongly recommend that you skip all BDD style assertion libraries - Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott/i-strongly-recommend-that-you-skip-all-bdd-style-assertion-libraries-including-code-acae26344d4)
- No mocking libraries.
  - [Mocking is a code smell - Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a)
- No hooks, i.e. beforeEach, afterEach.
- No globals.

## Approach

The application is tested from the outside-in, starting with the components. A component's behaviour is tested by the effect it has on other components, treating the low level details as a black box. These are "sociable" as opposed to "solitary" unit tests.

__Example: Tips modal triggered by link in nav bar__

This test creates a 'nav bar' and a 'tips modal'; clicks the 'tips link' in the nav bar; then asserts the tips modal has a class indicating it should be visible. The mechanics behind this interaction are a black box, making it resilient to implementation changes which enables merciless refactoring.

<%- renderJsFile('tests/components/tips.test.js') %>

Not every component is tested directly. Many low level components can be treated as a black box when exercised by a higher level component. 

Components are not designed and tested as though they'll be soon extracted as a reusable component library. This means components can be tested under the conditions they're used by this application, rather than how they might hypothetically be used by unknown consumers. This reduces the testing burden by allowing us to make reasonable assumptions about interactions between components, validity of parameters/data used, etc.

The intent with black box testing is to minimise the chances of tests breaking due to implmentation changes and thereby support merciless refactoring. 

Exceptions are made to the black box approach under certain conditions:

1. Combinatorial explosion
2. System boundary
3. Narrow feedback


### 1. Combinatorial explosion

e.g. image file names, tag names entered directly on tags, and email addresses entered into gravatar are actually expressions which could be just a name (no email address), and are parsed to extract an optional role name with "+rolename". But + is also a valid character within an email address. So example inputs to be tested could be: foo, foo+role, foo@bar.com, foo@bar.com+role, foo+abc@bar.com+role. These combinations are tested at the service layer, closer to the implementation. The gravatar component uses an example input instead. 

### 2. System boundary

Where the execution path will reach a system boundary, stub just short of the integration to avoid coupling the test to the low level implementation details of the integration.

__Example: Gravatar service functions stubbed__

This test creates a 'gravatar modal' and a 'tag list'. Clicking the 'import button' will render a tag in the tag list using data fetched from Gravatar. The `fetchProfileAsync` and `fetchImageAsync` functions are stubbed to prevent the integration from occurring and to avoid coupling the test to the implementation details of the integration. 

<%- renderJsFile('tests/components/gravatar/import-success.test.js') %>

### 3. Narrow feedback

When it's helpful to narrow down failure feedback when execution path is too coarse. e.g. state-store evolved with the application rather than being built up-front. The state-store could be covered by the component tests but it's sufficiently complicated to justify it's own tests.

This testing approach supports classic TDD more so than mockist TDD.

# Dependencies

## Position

The position taken in this application is to view depenendencies as liabilities.
That's not to say dependencies should be avoided at all costs.
The constraints below are designed to minimise dependencies and encourage due diligence in cases where dependencies might be appropriate.

## Constraints

<%- dependencies.constraints %>

The following sections lists all dependencies, including:

- Description and Homepage taken from package.json.
- Number of production dependencies followed by:
  - :boom: = 0 dependencies, :white_check_mark: = 1-9 dependencies, :warning: = 10+ dependencies
  - NB: There's no science behind these numbers. This is simply a guide to help keep the number of dependencies low.
  - NB: It would be even better to list the total number of dependencies in the entire dependency tree.
- Description of what the dependency is used for.
- Clarifying comments against the constraints listed above.

<%- dependencies.production %>

## Development dependencies

<%- dependencies.development %>

# Conventions

### Prefix $ to variables storing HTML element and $$ for collections of HTML elements

I generally prefer to avoid variable prefixes but I've found these prefixes help in a couple of ways:

1. Improves visual scanning of code making it faster to interpret.
2. Avoids naming conflicts, e.g. `$tagName.textContext = tagName;`

### Clarifying comments as footnotes

Such comments are secondary to the code and so follow the code rather than preceed it.

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/tag-list/tag/components/tag-image.js', { includeFootnotes: true }) %>

### Async functions end with the word Async

This just makes it easier to know when to use `await`.

### Functional programming

- Prefer `const` over `let`, and avoid `var`.
- Prefer higher-order functions such as `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, over imperative looping statements.
