This is a hobby project I decided to double as an experiment in developing a web application in JavaScript without the aid of a framework like React or Angular. Such an approach is often referred to as frameworkless, or vanilla JavaScript.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the approaches used are intentionally unconventional. Any attempt to emulate these approaches should be done with the unique needs and circumstances of your endeavour taken into consideration.

# Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture.svg)

Omitted for brievity:
- __Lib__: All depend on Lib except Config and IO.
- __Config__: All depend on Config except Elements and Lib.

A familiar presentation/domain/data __layered architecture__ has been used to manage __separation of concerns__. This is a common approach to modularise backend applications and therefore I hypothesise this design will be more approachable for backend developers.

## Architectural components

### Components

A plain object graph containing only _component builder functions_.

A __component builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to both user interaction and state changes (via subscriptions), may self-mutate, and interact with services.

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/tag-list/tag/components/tag-name.js') %>

Because component builder functions simply return native HTML elements, they can easily be appended to create component hierarchies.

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/header/header.js') %>

### Elements

A plain object graph containing only _element builder functions_.

An __element builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to user interaction, and may self-mutate.

Elements are 'fundamental' components. Unlike components, they cannot react to state changes or interact with services. For this reason, elements tend to be lower level, generic, and reusable.

<%- renderJsFile('src/elements/editable-span.js') %>

### Services

A plain object graph containing only _service functions_.

A __service function__ orchestrates domain logic and IO including state changes.

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __services__ comprise the 'imperative shell'.

<%- renderJsFile('src/services/tags/change-tag-instance-name.js') %>

### Core

A plain object graph containing only _pure functions_.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function):
> In computer programming, a __pure function__ is a function that has the following properties:
> 1. Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices).
> 2. Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __core__ comprises the 'functional core'.

<%- renderJsFile('src/core/tags/parse-tag-expression.js') %>

### IO

A plain object graph containing only functions that that depend on or act on the environment. 

<%- renderJsFile('src/io/io.js') %>

### Subscriptions

A plain object graph containing only _subscription functions_.

A __subscription function__ enables a listener to be notified of state changes.

### Stores

A plain object graph containing only instances of _state stores_.

A __state store__ encapsulates state mutations and notifications.

### Lib

A plain object graph containing only utility functions without collaborators.

### Config

A plain object graph containing only primitive data types.

# State management

Avoiding state management libraries forces the need for a bespoke state management solution.
No attempt is made to generify the state management solution for reuse by other applications; rather it is designed to evolve with the specific needs of the application.

## Stores

State is managed by a series of _state stores_. 

A **state store** is collection of data items keyed by a unique identifier and managed using typical CRUD operations such as `insert`, `remove`, `getState`, `setState`.

<%- renderJsFile('src/lib/storage/state-store.js', { open: false }) %>

__Example: Inserting a role using `insert`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/services/roles/insert-role.js') %>

__Example: Changing a role name using `getState` and `setState`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/services/tags/change-tag-instance-role.js') %>

# Dependencies

Constraints:

<%- dependencies.constraints %>

## Production dependencies

<%- dependencies.production %>

## Development dependencies

<%- dependencies.development %>

# Conventions

### Prefix $ to variables storing HTML element and $$ for collections of HTML elements

I generally prefer to avoid variable prefixes but I've found these prefixes help in a couple of ways:

1. Improves visual scanning of code making it faster to interpret.
2. Avoids naming conflicts, e.g. `$tagName.textContext = tagName;`

### Clarifying comments as footnotes

Such comments are secondary to the code and so follow the code rather than preceed it.

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/tag-list/tag/components/tag-image.js', { includeFootnotes: true }) %>

### Functional programming

- Prefer `const` over `let`, and avoid `var`.
- Prefer higher-order functions such as `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, over imperative looping statements.
