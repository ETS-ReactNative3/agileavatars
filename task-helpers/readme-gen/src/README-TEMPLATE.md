This is a hobby project I decided to double as an experiment in developing a web application in JavaScript without the aid of a framework like React or Angular. Such an approach is often referred to as frameworkless, or vanilla JavaScript.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the approaches used may be unconventional. Any attempt to emulate these approaches should be done with the unique needs and circumstances of your endeavour taken into consideration.

# Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture.svg)

Omitted for brievity:
- __Lib__: All depend on Lib except Config and IO.
- __Config__: All depend on Config except Elements and Lib.

A familiar presentation/domain/data __layered architecture__ has been used to manage __separation of concerns__. This is a common approach to modularise backend applications and therefore I hypothesise this design will be more approachable for backend developers.

## Modules

During initialisation, all source files comprising a module are loaded and aggregated into a plain object graph. This is helpful for shifting our mental model from files to modules. Each module has a clear purpose and relationships between modules are explicitly defined. See [Initialisation](#initialisation) for more details.

### Components

An aggregation of _component builder functions_.

A __component builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to both user interaction and state changes (via subscriptions), may self-mutate, and interact with services.

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/tag-list/tag/components/tag-name.js') %>

Because component builder functions simply return native HTML elements, they can easily be appended to create component hierarchies.

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/header/header.js') %>

### Elements

An aggregation of _element builder functions_.

An __element builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to user interaction, and may self-mutate.

Elements are 'fundamental' components. Unlike components, they cannot react to state changes or interact with services. For this reason, elements tend to be lower level, generic, and reusable.

<%- renderJsFile('src/elements/editable-span.js') %>

### Services

An aggregation of _service functions_.

A __service function__ orchestrates domain logic and IO including state changes.

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __services__ comprise the 'imperative shell'.

<%- renderJsFile('src/services/tags/change-tag-instance-name.js') %>

### Core

An aggregation of _pure functions_.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function):
> In computer programming, a __pure function__ is a function that has the following properties:
> 1. Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices).
> 2. Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __core__ comprises the 'functional core'.

<%- renderJsFile('src/core/tags/parse-tag-expression.js') %>

### IO

An aggregation of functions that depend on or act on the environment. 

<%- renderJsFile('src/io/io.js') %>

### Subscriptions

An aggregation of _subscription functions_.

A __subscription function__ enables a listener to be notified of state changes.

### Stores

An aggregation of _state stores_.

A __state store__ encapsulates state mutations and subscriptions for state changes.

### Lib

An aggregation of utility functions.

### Config

A plain object graph of configuration data.

# Initialisation

The application is initialised by invoking the function exported by `./boot.js`. This `boot` function has 1 required argument - `window`. The entire application depends on this supplied instance of `window` rather than depending on the global `window` object.

Initialisation involves loading configuration, composing modules, and invoking startup procedures. Initialising the application does not launch it; rather it returns initialised modules for use by a consumer. This enables the application to be interacted with in a variety of ways.

<%- renderJsFile('boot.js') %>

## Launching the application

A single HTML file at `./public/index.html` loads `./public/app.js` using a `<script>` tag. `app.js` initialises the application and supplies the global `window` object as an argument. Once initialised, the `components` module is used to create the top level `app` component and appends it to the DOM. The `services` module is also used to activate the `welcome` modal. 

<%- renderJsFile('public/app.js') %>

The initialised application is also assigned to `window.agileavatars` for debugging purposes:
![Modules displayed in the console](docs/console-modules.png)

This can also be used to view the current state of the application:
![State displayed in the console](docs/console-state.png)

## Testing the application

Rather than acting on individual files, tests act on the initialised application. 

__Example: A component test that depends on shared state__

This test initialises the application by calling the `boot` function and uses the `components` module to create an 'options bar' which should initially be hidden. It then uses the `services` module to insert a tag which should cause the options bar to become visible. 

<%- renderJsFile('tests/components/options-bar.test.js') %>

NB: As mentioned previously, the `boot` function has 1 required argument - `window`. This version of the `boot` function is actually a wrapper that supplies an instance of `window` provided by [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) to the original `boot` function for testing purposes.

__Example: A service test that depends on IO__

This test initialises the application by calling the `boot` function, overriding the `random` function in the `io` module. Any arguments supplied to `boot` apart from `window` are taken as __module overrides__. This effectively enables the use of a __test double__ without the need for a library.

<%- renderJsFile('tests/services/roles/random-color.test.js') %>

# State management

Avoiding state management libraries forces the need for a bespoke state management solution.
No attempt is made to generify the state management solution for reuse by other applications; rather it is designed to evolve with the specific needs of this application.

## Stores

State is managed by a series of _state stores_. 

A **state store** is collection of data items keyed by a unique identifier and managed using typical CRUD operations such as `insert`, `find`, `update`, `remove`.

<%- renderJsFile('src/lib/storage/state-store.js', { open: false }) %>

__Example: Inserting a role using `insert`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/services/roles/insert-role.js') %>

__Example: Changing a role name using `find` and `update`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/services/roles/change-role-name.js') %>

## Subscriptions

State stores use the [observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to enable consumers to react to state changes by associating _listener_ functions to events such as `onInsert` and `onChange`.

The observer pattern is easily implemented with Node's [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) which can be bundled directly into the application.

During startup, subscription functions are extracted from the stores into a standalone _subscriptions_ object. This decouples subscribers (namely _services_ and _components_) from the stores making them agnostic of the data source. Although not a design goal for this application, this should allow the data source to change without impacting the subscribers provided the interface of the subscription functions do not change.

__Example: Reacting to a new role using `onInsert` and `onFirstInsert`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/role-list/role-list.js') %>

__Example: Reacting to the change of a role name using `onChange`__

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/role-list/role-customiser/master-role-name.js') %>


# Testing 

## Position

The position taken in this application is that tests should enable __Merciless Refactoring__. The constraints below are designed to enable the application to change significantly and rapidly.

- [Refactor Mercilessly - Ward Cunningham](https://wiki.c2.com/?RefactorMercilessly)
- [Refactor Mercilessly - Don Wells](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/refactor.html)

## Constraints

- Unit test suite optimised for speed. Max 10 seconds.
  - [TDD test suites should run in 10 seconds or less - Mark Seemann](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/05/24/TDDtestsuitesshouldrunin10secondsorless/)
- No BDD style assertion libraries, e.g. expect. Used assert instead.
  - [I strongly recommend that you skip all BDD style assertion libraries - Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott/i-strongly-recommend-that-you-skip-all-bdd-style-assertion-libraries-including-code-acae26344d4)
- No mocking libraries.
  - [Mocking is a code smell - Eric Elliott](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a)
- No hooks, i.e. beforeEach, afterEach.
- No globals.

## Approach

The application is tested from the outside-in, starting with the components. A component's behaviour is tested by the effect it has on other components, treating the low level details as a black box. These are "sociable" as opposed to "solitary" unit tests.

__Example: Tips modal triggered by link in nav bar__

This test creates a 'nav bar' and a 'tips modal'; clicks the 'tips link' in the nav bar; then asserts the tips modal has a class indicating it should be visible. The mechanics behind this interaction are a black box, making it resilient to implementation changes which enables merciless refactoring.

<%- renderJsFile('tests/components/tips.test.js') %>

Not every component is tested directly. Many low level components can be treated as a black box when exercised by a higher level component. 

Components are not designed and tested as though they'll be soon extracted as a reusable component library. This means components can be tested under the conditions they're used by this application, rather than how they might hypothetically be used by unknown consumers. This reduces the testing burden by allowing us to make reasonable assumptions about interactions between components, validity of parameters/data used, etc.

The intent with black box testing is to minimise the chances of tests breaking due to implmentation changes and thereby support merciless refactoring. 

Exceptions are made to the black box approach under certain conditions:

1. System boundary
2. Narrow feedback



### 2. System boundary

Where the execution path will reach a system boundary, stub just short of the integration to avoid coupling the test to the low level implementation details of the integration.

__Example: Gravatar service functions stubbed__

This test creates a 'gravatar modal' and a 'tag list'. Clicking the 'import button' will render a tag in the tag list using data fetched from Gravatar. The `fetchProfileAsync` and `fetchImageAsync` functions are stubbed to prevent the integration from occurring and to avoid coupling the test to the implementation details of the integration. 

<%- renderJsFile('tests/components/gravatar/import-success.test.js') %>

### 3. Narrow feedback

When it's helpful to narrow down failure feedback when execution path is too coarse. e.g. state-store evolved with the application rather than being built up-front. The state-store could be covered by the component tests but it's sufficiently complicated to justify it's own tests.

This testing approach supports classic TDD more so than mockist TDD.

# Dependencies

## Position

The position taken in this application is to view depenendencies as liabilities.
That's not to say dependencies should be avoided at all costs.
The constraints below are designed to minimise dependencies and encourage due diligence in cases where dependencies might be appropriate.

## Constraints

<%- dependencies.constraints %>

The following sections lists all dependencies, including:

- Description and Homepage taken from package.json.
- Number of production dependencies followed by:
  - :boom: = 0 dependencies, :white_check_mark: = 1-9 dependencies, :warning: = 10+ dependencies
  - NB: There's no science behind these numbers. This is simply a guide to help keep the number of dependencies low.
  - NB: It would be even better to list the total number of dependencies in the entire dependency tree.
- Description of what the dependency is used for.
- Clarifying comments against the constraints listed above.
  
## Production dependencies

<%- dependencies.production %>

## Development dependencies

<%- dependencies.development %>

# Conventions

### Prefix $ to variables storing HTML element and $$ for collections of HTML elements

I generally prefer to avoid variable prefixes but I've found these prefixes help in a couple of ways:

1. Improves visual scanning of code making it faster to interpret.
2. Avoids naming conflicts, e.g. `$tagName.textContext = tagName;`

### Clarifying comments as footnotes

Such comments are secondary to the code and so follow the code rather than preceed it.

<%- renderJsFile('src/components/tag-list/tag/components/tag-image.js', { includeFootnotes: true }) %>

### Async functions end with the word Async

This just makes it easier to know when to use `await`.

### Functional programming

- Prefer `const` over `let`, and avoid `var`.
- Prefer higher-order functions such as `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, over imperative looping statements.
- Separate pure from impure functions.

# Observations

### No id required on elements. No need to query for elements.

Because ultimately this approach uses `document.createElement` to create elements, and all interaction with elements are encapsulated within builder functions, we always have a direct reference to the element. This eliminates the need to assign an id, or lookup elements using `document.getElementById` or `document.querySelector` or some variation of these.
