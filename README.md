This is a hobby project I decided to double as an experiment in developing a web application in JavaScript without the aid of a framework like React or Angular. Such an approach is often referred to as frameworkless, or vanilla JavaScript.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the approaches used are intentionally unconventional. Any attempt to emulate these approaches should be done with the unique needs and circumstances of your endeavour taken into consideration.

# Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture.svg)

Omitted for brievity:
- __Lib__: All depend on Lib except Config and IO.
- __Config__: All depend on Config except Elements and Lib.

A familiar presentation/domain/data __layered architecture__ has been used to manage __separation of concerns__. This is a common approach to modularise backend applications and therefore I hypothesise this design will be more approachable for backend developers.

## Architectural components

### Components

A plain object graph containing only _component builder functions_.

A __component builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to both user interaction and state changes (via subscriptions), may self-mutate, and interact with services.

<details open>
<summary>src/components/tag-list/tag/components/tag-name.js</summary>

```js
module.exports = ({ elements, services, subscriptions }) => tagInstanceId => {

    const $tagName = elements.editableSpan('tag-name')
        .addEventListener('change', () => {
            services.tags.changeTagInstanceName(tagInstanceId, $tagName.textContent);
        });

    subscriptions.tagInstances.onChange(tagInstanceId, 'tagName', tagName => {
        $tagName.textContent = tagName;
    });

    return $tagName;

};
```
</details>

Because component builder functions simply return native HTML elements, they can easily be appended to create component hierarchies.

<details open>
<summary>src/components/header/header.js</summary>

```js
module.exports = ({ el, header }) => () => {

    return el('header').append(
        header.titleBar(), 
        header.navBar()
    );
    
};
```
</details>

__Why not decouple components from services?__

TODO: Consider splitting and/or moving this section.

Many patterns and frameworks exist to decouple views from effects. Well known examples include MVC, Flux, pub/sub (and their derivatives). Every pattern and framework inherently comes with trade-offs, and patterns inevitably lead to frameworks. 

From a technical perspective these patterns and frameworks can introduce a fair degree of boilerplate and indirection. Redux is extremely popular, yet many developers complain about the learning curve, boilerplate and needless complexity, and yearn for a simpler solution.

There are also human elements to consider:
- Initial learning curve to productivity.
- Subsequent Learning curve to mastery.
- Encountering numerous variations of these patterns and frameworks reducing the time available to achieve mastery of any of them.
- Not knowing what good looks like and whether it's helping or hindering compared to other options.
- Not actually analysing the trade-offs and going with popular choice.

Bucking the trend as part of the experiment, I am allowing components to also be controllers in that they can effect change by calling on services directly. In order to limit complexity, components are kept small, typically encapsulating one or a small number of interactions.

### Elements

A plain object graph containing only _element builder functions_.

An __element builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to user interaction, and may self-mutate.

Elements are 'fundamental' components. Unlike components, they cannot react to state changes or interact with services. For this reason, elements tend to be lower level, generic, and reusable.

<details open>
<summary>src/elements/editable-span.js</summary>

```js
module.exports = ({ window, elements }) => className => {

    const dispatchChange = () => $span.dispatchEvent(new window.Event('change'));

    const $span = elements.el('span', className)
        .addEventListener('blur', () => {
            dispatchChange();
        })
        .addEventListener('keydown', e => {            
            if (e.code === 'Enter') {
                e.preventDefault();
                dispatchChange();
            }
        });
    
    $span.setAttribute('contenteditable', true);

    return $span;
};
```
</details>

### Services

A plain object graph containing only _service functions_.

A __service function__ orchestrates domain logic and IO including state changes.

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __services__ comprise the 'imperative shell'.

<details open>
<summary>src/services/tags/change-tag-instance-name.js</summary>

```js
module.exports = ({ core, services, stores }) => (tagInstanceId, expression) => {

    const { tagId } = services.tags.getTagInstance(tagInstanceId);
    const { tagName, roleName } = core.tags.parseTagExpression(expression);

    stores.tags.setState(tagId, { tagName });

    if (roleName) {
        const roleId = services.roles.findOrInsertRoleWithName(roleName);
        stores.tags.setState(tagId, { roleId });
    }
    
};
```
</details>

### Core

A plain object graph containing only _pure functions_.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function):
> In computer programming, a __pure function__ is a function that has the following properties:
> 1. Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices).
> 2. Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __core__ comprises the 'functional core'.

<details open>
<summary>src/core/tags/parse-tag-expression.js</summary>

```js
module.exports = () => expression => {

    const [tagName, roleName] = expression.split('+').map(s => s.trim());        
    return { tagName, roleName };

};
```
</details>

### IO

A plain object graph containing only functions that that depend on or act on the environment. 

<details open>
<summary>src/io/io.js</summary>

```js
module.exports = ({ window }) => {

    return {
        random: window.Math.random,
        fetch: window.fetch.bind(window),
        date: () => new window.Date(),
        createFileReader: () => new window.FileReader()
    };

};
```
</details>

### Subscriptions

A plain object graph containing only _subscription functions_.

A __subscription function__ enables a listener to be notified of state changes.

### Stores

A plain object graph containing only instances of _state stores_.

A __state store__ encapsulates state mutations and notifications.

### Lib

A plain object graph containing only utility functions without collaborators.

### Config

A plain object graph containing only primitive data types.

# State management

<details >
<summary>src/lib/storage/state-store.js</summary>

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');

module.exports = localState => {
    let nextId = 1;
    const funcIndex = {};
    const collectionEmitter = new EventEmitter();

    const manage = id => funcIndex[id] ?? { getState: () => null };
    const getArray = () => Object.values(localState);
    const getState = id => manage(id).getState();
    const setState = (id, changes) => manage(id).setState(changes);

    const onChange = (id, key, listener) => manage(id).subscriptions.onChange(key, listener);
    const onChangeAny = (key, listener) => collectionEmitter.on(key, listener);
    const onInsert = listener => collectionEmitter.on('insert', listener);
    const onFirstInsert = listener => collectionEmitter.once('firstInsert', listener);
    const onBeforeRemove = listener => collectionEmitter.on('beforeRemove', listener);
    const subscriptions = { onChange, onChangeAny, onInsert, onFirstInsert, onBeforeRemove };

    const insert = (data, callback) => {
        const id = nextId++;
        const state = { id, ...data };
        const itemEmitter = new EventEmitter();

        const getState = () => ({ ...state });

        const setState = changes => {
            Object.entries(changes).forEach(([key, val]) => {
                if (state[key] === val) return;
                state[key] = val;
                const emit = emitter => emitter.emit(key, state[key], state);
                [itemEmitter, collectionEmitter].forEach(emit);
            });
        };

        const onChange = (key, listener) => {
            itemEmitter.on(key, listener);
            const invoke = () => listener(state[key], state);
            invoke();
        };

        const subscriptions = { onChange };
        localState[id] = state;  
        funcIndex[id] = { getState, setState, subscriptions };

        if (callback) callback(id);
        collectionEmitter.emit('firstInsert', id);
        collectionEmitter.emit('insert', id);
        return id;
    };

    const remove = id => {
        collectionEmitter.emit('beforeRemove', id);
        delete funcIndex[id];
        delete localState[id];
    };

    return { manage, insert, remove, getArray, getState, setState, subscriptions };

};

# Constraints

## System quality attributes

### Learnability

- Prioritise for beginner-friendliness, or [Shoshin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin), meaning "beginner's mind".
- Minimise the need for prerequisite knowledge.
- Minimise the number of elements to learn beyond native JavaScript and basic design patterns.
- Minimise the use of obscure language features.
- When multiple options exist, use the simplest tool for the job.

### Maintainability

- Minimise dependencies to reduce security concerns and upgrade cycles.
- Clean code. [Here's a good summary](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29).
- Adopt functional programming techniques with a low learninig curve, supported by native JavaScript.

## Design decisions

### Autogenerated index.js files

Constraints:
- `index.js` files must load and export sibling files and directories.
- Non-`index.js` files must only load directories (i.e. `index.js` files).

Implications:
- Files are loaded only once each.
- Results are shared by "passing down" using function arguments.
- Non-`index.js` files have very few import/require statements.
- `index.js` files have a single responsibility.
- `index.js` files don't contain logic.
- `index.js` files could be generated.
- Increases likelihood that any logic is placed in appropriately named file, which improves searchability.
- Increase the likelihood that dependencies will be structured in a logical and predictable manner.

Avoids:
- Source files starting with potentially large blocks of import/require statements.
- Loading the same file multiple times with a slighly different relative path.
- Coupling to file paths in general.

### Minimise test doubles and avoid mocking libraries

Eric Elliott's [Mocking is a code smell](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a) says it all:

> Mocking is required when our decomposition strategy has failed.

Encourages:
- Loose coupling.
- Test doubles without the aid of a library.



# Dependencies

## Production dependencies


### @sentry/browser

> Official Sentry SDK for browsers\
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/browser

#### Purpose

Monitoring and alerting.


### blueimp-md5

> JavaScript MD5 implementation. Compatible with server-side environments like Node.js, module loaders like RequireJS, Browserify or webpack and all web browsers.\
https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5

Hashing of email addresses for use with the Gravatar service.

:white_check_mark: __Decision is not driven by hype or popularity__\
      blueimp-md5 is not the most widely used MD5 implementation in JavaScript.

:white_check_mark: __No suitable built-in JavaScript alternative exists__\
      JavaScript does not feature a built-in MD5 implementation.

:white_check_mark: __Not trivial to implement with vanilla JavaScript__\
      The MD5 algorithm is non-trivial and is a well solved problem.

:white_check_mark: __No suitable built-in Node.js equivalent exists__\
      The crypto module supports MD5. It doesn't seem possible to extract individual algorithms from crypto. The consequence is a minified bundle size of 431.78 KB compared with 4.86 KB for blueimp-md5 which is a significant difference.

:white_check_mark: __No alternative that more closely matches the need exists__\
      According to [this issue](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5/issues/26), the original use case was to hash email addresses for Gravatar.

:white_check_mark: __No alternative with fewer dependencies exists__\
      blueimp-md5 has zero dependencies. md5 although more more widely used, has 3 dependencies.

:white_check_mark: __Widely used__\
      blueimp-md5 is widely used at 565,584 weekly downloads. md5 is more widely used at 2,676,589 weekly downloads.

:white_check_mark: __Usage is isolated__

:white_check_mark: __Low maintenance__

:white_check_mark: __Low likelihood of changing in a material way__

:white_check_mark: __Low impact of material change__\
      The cost of identifying and integrating an alternative MD5 implementation is low.


### lodash

> Lodash modular utilities.\
https://lodash.com/

Utility functions where there's no suitable built-in JavaScript alternative.

:white_check_mark: __Decision is not driven by hype or popularity__

:white_check_mark: __No suitable built-in JavaScript alternative exists__\
      Many lodash utility functions do have suitable built-in JavaScript alternatives. lodash is only used where this is not the case.

:white_check_mark: __Not trivial to implement with vanilla JavaScript__\
      Most of the utlity functions used are non-trivial.

:white_check_mark: __No suitable built-in Node.js equivalent exists__

:white_check_mark: __No alternative that more closely matches the need exists__\
      Each lodash utility function does have a standalone package available on NPM. Given more than a couple of utility functions are being used, a single dependency on lodash is easier to manage.

:white_check_mark: __No alternative with fewer dependencies exists__\
      lodash has zero dependencies.

:white_check_mark: __Widely used__\
      lodash is widely used at 34,556,582 weekly downloads.

:white_check_mark: __Usage is isolated__

:white_check_mark: __Low maintenance__

:white_check_mark: __Low likelihood of changing in a material way__

:white_check_mark: __Low impact of material change__\
      The cost of identifying and integrating an alternative utility library is low.


### module-composer

> Module composition using partial function application\

:white_check_mark: __No suitable built-in Node.js equivalent exists__

:white_check_mark: __No alternative that more closely matches the need exists__\
      This library was built with the specific constraints of Agile Avatars in mind.

:white_check_mark: __No alternative with fewer dependencies exists__

:warning: __Widely used__

### vanilla-picker

> A simple, easy to use vanilla JS color picker with alpha selection.\
https://vanilla-picker.js.org

#### Purpose

Used to change the colour of each role.

#### Alternatives considered

- It was suprisingly hard to find a good looking, easy to use color picker writting in vanilla JavaScript. Many color pickers are implemented as jQuery plugins.

#### Implementation notes

- I am using a fork which I have customised to accept a window object in order to avoid globals.

# Conventions

### Prefix $ to variables storing HTML element and $$ for collections of HTML elements

I generally prefer to avoid variable prefixes but I've found these prefixes help in a couple of ways:

1. Improves visual scanning of code making it faster to interpret.
2. Avoids naming conflicts, e.g. `$tagName.textContext = tagName;`

### Clarifying comments as footnotes

Such comments are secondary to the code and so follow the code rather than preceed it.

<details open>
<summary>src/components/tag-list/tag/components/tag-image.js</summary>

```js
module.exports = ({ el }) => () => {

    return el('div', 'tag-image');

};

/* FOOTNOTES

Actual image is rendered using CSS background-image as a performance optimisation.

*/
```
</details>

### Functional programming

- Prefer `const` over `let`, and avoid `var`.
- Prefer higher-order functions such as `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, over imperative looping statements.
- Prefer currying dependencies over constructors (classes), e.g. `({ dep1, dep2 }) => ({ arg1, arg2 }) => { ... }`
