This is a hobby project I decided to double as an experiment in developing a web application in JavaScript without the aid of a framework like React or Angular. Such an approach is often referred to as frameworkless, or vanilla JavaScript.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the approaches used are intentionally unconventional. Any attempt to emulate these approaches should be done with the unique needs and circumstances of your endeavour taken into consideration.

# Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture.svg)

Omitted for brievity:
- __Lib__: All depend on Lib except Config and IO.
- __Config__: All depend on Config except Elements and Lib.

A familiar presentation/domain/data __layered architecture__ has been used to manage __separation of concerns__. This is a common approach to modularise backend applications and therefore I hypothesise this design will be more approachable for backend developers.

Further reading:
- [PresentationDomainDataLayering - Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PresentationDomainDataLayering.html)

## Architectural components

### Components

A plain object graph containing only _component builder functions_.

A __component builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to both user interaction and state changes (via subscriptions), may self-mutate, and interact with services.

<%- renderJsFile(examples.component) %>

Because component builder functions simply return native HTML elements, they can easily be appended to create component hierarchies.

<%- renderJsFile(examples.componentAppend) %>

__Why not decouple components from services?__

TODO: Consider splitting and/or moving this section.

Many patterns and frameworks exist to decouple views from effects. Well known examples include MVC, Flux, pub/sub (and their derivatives). Every pattern and framework inherently comes with trade-offs, and patterns inevitably lead to frameworks. 

From a technical perspective these patterns and frameworks can introduce a fair degree of boilerplate and indirection. Redux is extremely popular, yet many developers complain about the learning curve, boilerplate and needless complexity, and yearn for a simpler solution.

There are also human elements to consider:
- Initial learning curve to productivity.
- Subsequent Learning curve to mastery.
- Encountering numerous variations of these patterns and frameworks reducing the time available to achieve mastery of any of them.
- Not knowing what good looks like and whether it's helping or hindering compared to other options.
- Not actually analysing the trade-offs and going with popular choice.

Bucking the trend as part of the experiment, I am allowing components to also be controllers in that they can effect change by calling on services directly. In order to limit complexity, components are kept small, typically encapsulating one or a small number of interactions.

### Elements

A plain object graph containing only _element builder functions_.

An __element builder function__ returns an object deriving [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) using closures to react to user interaction, and may self-mutate.

Elements are 'fundamental' components. Unlike components, they cannot react to state changes or interact with services. For this reason, elements tend to be lower level, generic, and reusable.

<%- renderJsFile(examples.element) %>

### Services

A plain object graph containing only _service functions_.

A __service function__ orchestrates domain logic and IO including state changes.

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __services__ comprise the 'imperative shell'.

<%- renderJsFile(examples.service) %>

### Core

A plain object graph containing only _pure functions_.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function):
> In computer programming, a __pure function__ is a function that has the following properties:
> 1. Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices).
> 2. Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).

Inspired by [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), __core__ comprises the 'functional core'.

<%- renderJsFile(examples.core) %>

### IO

A plain object graph containing only functions that that depend on or act on the environment. 

<%- renderJsFile(examples.io) %>

### Subscriptions

A plain object graph containing only _subscription functions_.

A __subscription function__ enables a listener to be notified of state changes.

### Stores

A plain object graph containing only instances of _state stores_.

A __state store__ encapsulates state mutations and notifications.

### Lib

A plain object graph containing only utility functions without collaborators.

### Config

A plain object graph containing only primitive data types.

# State management

<%- renderJsFile(stateStore, { open: false }) %>

# Constraints

## System quality attributes

### Learnability

- Prioritise for beginner-friendliness, or [Shoshin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin), meaning "beginner's mind".
- Minimise the need for prerequisite knowledge.
- Minimise the number of elements to learn beyond native JavaScript and basic design patterns.
- Minimise the use of obscure language features.
- When multiple options exist, use the simplest tool for the job.

### Maintainability

- Minimise dependencies to reduce security concerns and upgrade cycles.
- Clean code. [Here's a good summary](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29).
- Adopt functional programming techniques with a low learninig curve, supported by native JavaScript.

## Design features

### Autogenerated index.js files

Constraints:
- `index.js` files must load and export sibling files and directories.
- Non-`index.js` files must only load directories (i.e. `index.js` files).

Implications:
- Files are loaded only once each.
- Results are shared by "passing down" using function arguments.
- Non-`index.js` files have very few import/require statements.
- `index.js` files have a single responsibility.
- `index.js` files don't contain logic.
- `index.js` files could be generated.
- Increases likelihood that any logic is placed in appropriately named file, which improves searchability.
- Increase the likelihood that dependencies will be structured in a logical and predictable manner.

Avoids:
- Source files starting with potentially large blocks of import/require statements.
- Loading the same file multiple times with a slighly different relative path.
- Coupling to file paths in general.

### Minimise test doubles and avoid mocking libraries

Eric Elliott's [Mocking is a code smell](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a) says it all:

> Mocking is required when our decomposition strategy has failed.

Encourages:
- Loose coupling.
- Test doubles without the aid of a library.



# Dependencies

## Production dependencies

### @sentry/browser

The JavaScript SDK for Sentry, a cloud-based application monitoring service.

### blueimp-md5

A JavaScript implementation of the md5 hashing algorithm.

Notes:
- Used to hash email addresses sent to Gravatar.

__Why not use crypto from Node.js and avoid the extra dependency?__

As far as I can tell, it's not possible to extract individual algorithms from crypto. The consequence is a minified bundle size of 431.78 KB compared with blueimp's 4.86 KB. The difference is significant and justifies the extra dependency.

### lodash

A JavaScript utility library.

Notes:
- Used by exception where there's no concise native JavaScript alternative.
- Functions are required individually to minimise bundle size, e.g. `require('lodash/merge')`

### module-composer

Enables dependency injection using currying.

Notes:
- I am the author of this library.

### vanilla-picker

A vanilla JavaScript color picker. 

Notes:
- It was suprisingly hard to find a good looking, easy to use color picker writting in vanilla JavaScript. Many color pickers are implemented as jQuery plugins.
- I am using a fork which I have customised to accept a window object in order to avoid globals.

## Development dependencies

### ejs

A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

Used for:
- Generating `README.md` from a template to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

### eslint

A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

Notes:
- Also used for automatic code formatting.
- I had originally used prettier for code formatting but was regularly dissatisfied with the results.

### jsdom

Emulates a web browser for testing web applications with Node.js.

Notes:
- I had originally used in conjunction with jsdom-global until I decided to strictly limit use of globals.

### module-indexgen

Generates index.js files with Node.js.

Notes:
- I am also the author of this library.

### nyc

A JavaScript test coverage tool.

### parcel-bundler

A zero-configuration web application bundler.

Notes:
- I have found Parcel to be much simpler to use than webpack.

### tap-summary

A TAP (Test Anything Protocol) reporter.

Notes:
- A benefit of TAP is the variety of reporters available.
- tap-summary output is minimal and includes duration of each test which is useful for keeping the tests fast.

### tape

A very lightweight TAP producing test harness.

# Conventions

### Prefix $ to variables storing HTML element and $$ for collections of HTML elements

I generally prefer to avoid variable prefixes but I've found these prefixes help in a couple of ways:

1. Improves visual scanning of code making it faster to interpret.
2. Avoids naming conflicts, e.g. `$tagName.textContext = tagName;`

### Clarifying comments as footnotes

Such comments are secondary to the code and so follow the code rather than preceed it.

<%- renderJsFile(examples.footnote, { includeFootnotes: true }) %>

### Functional programming

- Prefer `const` over `let`, and avoid `var`.
- Prefer higher-order functions such as `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, over imperative looping statements.
- Prefer currying dependencies over constructors (classes), e.g. `({ dep1, dep2 }) => ({ arg1, arg2 }) => { ... }`
