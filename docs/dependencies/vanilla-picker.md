#### Purpose

Used to change the colour of each role.

#### Alternatives considered

- It was suprisingly hard to find a good looking, easy to use color picker writting in vanilla JavaScript. Many color pickers are implemented as jQuery plugins.

#### Implementation notes

- I am using a fork which I have customised to accept a window object in order to avoid globals.
