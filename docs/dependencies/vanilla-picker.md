A vanilla JavaScript color picker. 

Notes:
- It was suprisingly hard to find a good looking, easy to use color picker writting in vanilla JavaScript. Many color pickers are implemented as jQuery plugins.
- I am using a fork which I have customised to accept a window object in order to avoid globals.
