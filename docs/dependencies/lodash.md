#### Purpose

Used by exception where there's no concise native JavaScript implementation available.

#### Usage notes

- Each function should be required explicitly by path to minimise bundle size, e.g. `require('lodash/merge')`

#### Contingency plan

Change to one of the many other utility libraries available in JavaScript.
