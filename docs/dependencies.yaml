            comment: JavaScript does not feature a built-in MD5 implementation.

            comment: The crypto module supports MD5. It doesn't seem possible to extract individual algorithms from crypto. The consequence is a minified bundle size of 431.78 KB compared with 4.86 KB for blueimp-md5 which is a significant difference.
